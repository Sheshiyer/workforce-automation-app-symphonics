> This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the planned Workforce Automation App, a mobile-first application for field teams to manage energy efficiency interventions.

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a **documentation repository** that outlines the requirements, design specifications, data models, and implementation plans for the Workforce Automation App. The actual implementation has not yet begun - this repository serves as the foundation for future development.

### Purpose

The Workforce Automation App is designed to streamline the workflow of field installers performing energy efficiency interventions. It aims to:

- Eliminate paper-based processes
- Improve data accuracy
- Accelerate customer intervention completion
- Integrate with the Symphonics platform
