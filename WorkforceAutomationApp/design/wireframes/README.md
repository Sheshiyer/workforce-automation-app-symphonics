# Wireframes

This directory contains wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for the Workforce Automation App, organized by feature or screen.

## Organization

Wireframes are organized into the following categories:

1. **Authentication**
   - Login
   - Registration
   - Password Recovery

2. **Dashboard**
   - Home Screen
   - Intervention List
   - Status Filters

3. **Intervention Process**
   - Customer Information (Page 1)
   - Operations Selection (Page 2)
   - Photo Documentation (Page 3)
   - Finalization

4. **Administration**
   - Company Management
   - User Management
   - Intervention Administration

5. **Reporting**
   - Status Dashboard
   - Commission Reports
   - Performance Metrics

## File Naming Convention

Files follow this naming convention:
`[category]-[screen_name]-[version].png`

Example: `intervention-customer_info-v1.png`

## Design Tools

Wireframes are created using industry-standard design tools that support collaboration and versioning. The design process includes:

1. **Low-fidelity wireframes**: Initial sketches focusing on layout and information architecture
2. **Mid-fidelity wireframes**: More detailed designs with basic UI components and interactions
3. **High-fidelity mockups**: Polished designs with complete styling, accurate components, and visual design

## Mobile-First Approach

All wireframes follow a mobile-first approach, with the primary designs optimized for smartphone use. Additional variations may be provided for tablet and desktop views where relevant (particularly for back office interfaces).

## Prototype Links

Interactive prototypes demonstrating key user flows are available to the development team. These prototypes illustrate:

1. User registration and onboarding
2. Intervention creation and completion
3. Photo capture process
4. Document generation and signature
5. Administrative workflows

## Design Review Process

Wireframes undergo a structured review process:

1. Internal design review
2. Stakeholder feedback
3. User testing (where applicable)
4. Developer feasibility assessment
5. Final approval

## Implementation Notes

Each wireframe includes implementation notes detailing:

1. Component specifications
2. Interaction behaviors
3. State variations
4. Responsive considerations
5. Accessibility requirements

## Placeholder Notice

This directory will be populated with actual wireframe files as they are created during the design phase. The structure and organization described above will be maintained as designs are added.
