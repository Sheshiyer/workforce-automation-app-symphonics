# Workforce Automation App - Executive Summary

## Project Vision

The Workforce Automation App is designed to optimize the additional sales of energy efficiency equipment and services by enabling field personnel (installers, maintenance technicians, supplementary sales force) to effectively identify customer needs and complete sales processes on-site. The application streamlines the entire workflow from customer identification to contract completion, all through a mobile-first approach.

## Goals

1. **Streamlined Field Operations**: Enable field personnel to identify customer needs and immediately generate quotes and invoices on-site.
2. **Paperless Workflow**: Digitize all processes including document generation and electronic signatures.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Generate necessary attestations for CEE (Energy Efficiency Certificate) valorization.
4. **System Integration**: Transmit information via API to the Symphonics platform and third-party CRMs.
5. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor the activity of each installer and manage commission calculations.

## Business Value

1. **Increased Sales Conversion**: By enabling immediate quote generation and contract signing, the app reduces the sales cycle and increases conversion rates.
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Elimination of paper-based processes reduces administrative overhead and processing time.
3. **Data Accuracy**: Direct digital capture of customer information, site details, and photographic evidence ensures data integrity.
4. **Compliance Assurance**: Structured workflows ensure all regulatory requirements are met for energy efficiency certifications.
5. **Revenue Tracking**: Comprehensive reporting enables accurate commission calculations and business performance analysis.

## Target Format

The application will be accessible via smartphone, leveraging device capabilities including:
- Geolocation
- Camera for photo documentation
- Maps integration
- Integration with external services (OCR recognition, AI APIs)
- Integration with phone applications (Calendar, Maps)

The app will function on standard 4G networks without requiring WiFi connectivity.

## User Types

1. **Installer**: Field personnel who perform equipment installation or maintenance and handle service subscriptions.
2. **Back Office**: Symphonics employees with administrative rights to create companies, manage users, and oversee intervention lists.
3. **IT**: Symphonics technical staff responsible for UI evolution, service management, and database administration.

## MVP Scope

The initial MVP will focus on essential functionality for field teams installing water heater regulators and associated Symphonics contracts. This includes:
- Company account creation
- User management
- Basic intervention workflow
- Photo documentation
- Document generation
- Symphonics platform integration
- Basic reporting and commission tracking

## Implementation Approach

The project will follow a phased approach, starting with the MVP and gradually expanding to include additional features, product types, and integrations. The technical architecture will be designed from the outset to accommodate future enhancements while enabling rapid deployment of the initial version.
