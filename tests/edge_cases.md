# Edge Cases

This document details handling procedures for known edge cases, input validation, and user error scenarios in the Workforce Automation App.

## Data Input Edge Cases

### EC-001: Extremely Long Text Inputs

**Scenario**: User enters extremely long text in input fields (e.g., names, addresses, notes).

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Implement appropriate character limits for each field type:
   - Names: 100 characters
   - Addresses: 200 characters
   - Email addresses: 100 characters
   - Notes: 1000 characters
2. Provide visual feedback when approaching or exceeding limits
3. Truncate or reject input exceeding maximum length
4. Ensure database fields can accommodate maximum allowed input

**Validation Rules**:
- Validate input length on client-side before submission
- Validate input length on server-side as a security measure
- Log attempts to submit excessively long input

### EC-002: Special Characters and Unicode

**Scenario**: User enters special characters, emojis, or non-Latin characters in text fields.

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Support Unicode characters in all text fields
2. Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks
3. Ensure proper encoding/decoding throughout the system
4. Test with various character sets (Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, CJK, emojis)

**Validation Rules**:
- Allow Unicode characters in name fields
- Restrict special characters in structured fields (e.g., phone numbers)
- Sanitize all input for security

### EC-003: Zero or Empty Values

**Scenario**: User submits forms with empty or zero values for required fields.

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Clearly mark required fields
2. Validate required fields before form submission
3. Provide clear error messages for missing required fields
4. Prevent submission until all required fields are completed

**Validation Rules**:
- Required fields cannot be empty
- Numeric fields may have minimum values where appropriate
- Empty optional fields should be stored as NULL, not empty strings

## Numeric and Date Edge Cases

### EC-004: Extreme Numeric Values

**Scenario**: User enters extremely large or small numbers in numeric fields.

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Define reasonable min/max values for each numeric field
2. Validate input against these boundaries
3. Provide clear error messages for out-of-range values
4. Handle potential overflow/underflow in calculations

**Validation Rules**:
- Quantity fields: Minimum 1, reasonable maximum (e.g., 100)
- Price fields: Minimum 0, reasonable maximum (e.g., 100,000â‚¬)
- Percentage fields: 0-100 range

### EC-005: Date Range Issues

**Scenario**: User selects invalid date ranges or dates in the distant past/future.

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Define reasonable date ranges for each date field
2. Validate dates against business rules
3. Provide date pickers with appropriate constraints
4. Handle timezone differences consistently

**Validation Rules**:
- Intervention dates cannot be in the future
- Historical dates limited to reasonable past (e.g., 5 years)
- End dates must be after start dates

## File and Photo Edge Cases

### EC-006: Large File Uploads

**Scenario**: User attempts to upload very large photos or files.

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Define maximum file size limits (e.g., 10MB per photo)

4. Implement client-side image compression when possible

**Validation Rules**:
- Reject files exceeding size limits
- Compress images while maintaining sufficient quality
- Provide progress indicators for large uploads

### EC-007: Unsupported File Types

**Scenario**: User attempts to upload files with unsupported formats.

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Define whitelist of supported file types (e.g., JPEG, PNG, PDF)
2. Validate file type before upload begins
3. Provide clear feedback on supported formats
4. Verify file content matches extension (not just relying on extension)

**Validation Rules**:
- Photos: JPEG, PNG only
- Documents: PDF only
- Validate both MIME type and file extension

### EC-008: Missing Geolocation Data

**Scenario**: Photos are captured without geolocation data due to permissions or GPS issues.

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Verify geolocation permissions before photo capture
2. Prompt user to enable location services if disabled
3. Provide clear error message if geolocation data cannot be obtained
4. Block photo capture if geolocation is required but unavailable

**Validation Rules**:
- Geolocation data is required for certain photo types
- Accuracy threshold for geolocation data (e.g., <100m)
- Timestamp required for all photos

## Network and Connectivity Edge Cases

### EC-009: Intermittent Connectivity

**Scenario**: User experiences intermittent network connectivity during app usage.

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Implement offline-first architecture
2. Cache essential data for offline use
3. Queue operations that require connectivity
4. Synchronize when connectivity is restored
5. Provide clear offline indicators

**Validation Rules**:
- Detect network state changes
- Prioritize critical operations during limited connectivity
- Implement conflict resolution for offline edits

### EC-010: API Timeouts and Failures

**Scenario**: External API calls (e.g., Symphonics) timeout or return errors.

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Implement appropriate timeouts for all API calls
2. Provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. Degrade gracefully when APIs are unavailable
4. Cache previous successful responses when appropriate
5. Log all API failures for troubleshooting

**Validation Rules**:
- Maximum retry attempts (e.g., 3)
- Exponential backoff between retries
- Circuit breaker pattern for persistently failing APIs

## User Error Scenarios

### EC-011: Navigation Away During Form Completion

**Scenario**: User navigates away from a form before completing and submitting it.

**Handling Procedure**:
1. Implement auto-save for form data
2. Prompt user when attempting to navigate away from unsaved changes
3. Restore form state when user returns
4. Provide clear recovery options

**Validation Rules**:
- Auto-save after significant changes
- Confirm navigation away from unsaved changes
- Maintain form state in local storage
