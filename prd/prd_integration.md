# Integration Module Requirements

This document details the integration requirements for the Workforce Automation App, including APIs and data synchronization with Symphonics and other platforms.

## Symphonics Platform Integration

### IT001: Publish to Symphonics (MVP)

**Description**: Automatic transmission of completed intervention data to the Symphonics platform.

**Requirements**:
1. When an intervention reaches status "installation done" and the beneficiary has signed a Symphonics contract, the system must automatically send the dossier to the Symphonics platform.
2. The integration must use the API documented at https://api.symphonics.fr/crm/docs.
3. The system must handle API responses appropriately, including success confirmations and error handling.
4. The transmission must include all relevant intervention data, including:
   - Beneficiary information
   - Installation details
   - Operation codes
   - Product information
   - Document references
   - Photo references
5. The system must maintain a record of successful transmissions and retry logic for failed attempts.

### IT002: Distribute to Partners (Post-MVP)

**Description**: Distribution of intervention data to third-party IT partners.

**Requirements**:
1. The system must support subscription-based distribution of intervention data to third-party platforms.
2. The distribution must use the same API format as the Symphonics integration.
3. The system must maintain separate configuration for each partner integration.
4. Security measures must ensure data is only shared with authorized partners.
5. The system must maintain a record of successful transmissions and retry logic for failed attempts.

## External Service Integrations

### API Integration Requirements

1. **Symphonics API**:
   - The system must integrate with the following Symphonics API endpoints:
     - PDL validation: https://api.symphonics.fr/validation/docs#/default/getPdl
     - PDL lookup by address: https://api.symphonics.fr/validation/docs#/default/postPdlAddressLookup
     - User validation: https://api.symphonics.fr/validation/docs#/default/getUser
     - CRM data submission: https://api.symphonics.fr/crm/docs
   - Authentication must follow Symphonics API requirements.
   - The system must handle API rate limits and implement appropriate retry logic.

2. **OCR Service** (Post-MVP):
   - The system must integrate with an OCR service to:
     - Validate photo readability
     - Extract PDL and PCE numbers from meter photos
     - Verify document authenticity
   - The integration must handle various image formats and quality levels.
   - Performance must be optimized for mobile use with appropriate caching.

3. **Geolocation Services**:
   - The system must integrate with device geolocation APIs to:
     - Tag photos with precise location data
     - Assist with address entry (Post-MVP)
   - The integration must handle permission requests and fallback procedures.
   - The system must respect user privacy settings.

4. **Electronic Signature Service** (Post-MVP):
   - The system must integrate with an electronic signature service to:
     - Generate signature requests
     - Track signature status
     - Store signed documents
   - The integration must comply with legal requirements for electronic signatures.
   - The system must provide appropriate security measures for document handling.

## Data Synchronization

**Requirements**:
1. The system must implement appropriate synchronization mechanisms to handle offline operations.
2. Data conflicts must be resolved according to defined business rules.
3. The system must maintain a record of synchronization events and error handling.
4. Performance must be optimized for operation on 4G networks.

## Security Requirements

1. All API communications must use secure protocols (HTTPS).
2. Authentication credentials must be securely stored and managed.
3. Data transmission must be encrypted.
4. The system must implement appropriate access controls for API integrations.
5. The system must maintain audit logs of all integration activities.

## Future Integration Considerations

1. Integration with HIVE developed by Valoren
2. Integration with Thal√©os SAV tool
3. Support for additional third-party CRM systems
4. Enhanced data exchange capabilities
5. Real-time synchronization options
